              🐮 Cows and Bulls Game
Overview
> Cows and Bulls is a fun and challenging game of logic and deduction.
> In this game, the player must guess a randomly generated 4-digit number (or 4-letter word) chosen by the computer.
> Each guess gives the player feedback in terms of "cows" (correct digits in the wrong place) and "bulls" (correct digits in the correct place).
> The goal is to guess the correct number or word in as few attempts as possible.

How to Play
- Objective: Guess the 4-digit secret number with unique digits (or a 4-letter word, if using the word mode).
- Feedback:
     > Bull: A correct digit/letter in the correct position.
     > Cow: A correct digit/letter in the wrong position.
- Winning: The game ends when you have 4 bulls (all digits/letters are correct and in the right positions).

Game Modes
- Basic Mode (4-digit Number):
1.The default mode of the game where the player guesses a 4-digit number with unique digits.
   > Feedback is given in terms of cows and bulls.

2.Extended Mode - Numbers with Duplicate Digits:
   > Allows the computer to generate a 4-digit number with duplicate digits (e.g., 1123).
   > Feedback and gameplay remain the same.
3.Extended Mode - 4-Letter Words:
   > Instead of numbers, the computer chooses a 4-letter word from a predefined list.
   > Feedback uses the same cows and bulls concept, but with letters instead of digits.
